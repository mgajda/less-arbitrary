# Introduction

Property testing is the cheapest and most precise way of building up a test suite for your program.
Especially if the datatypes enjoy nice mathematical laws.
But it is also the easiest way to make it run for an unreasonably long time.
We prove connection between deeply recursive data structures, and epidemic growth rate, and show how to fix the problem.
After our intervention the Arbitrary instances run in linear time with respect to assumed test size.

# Motivation

Typical arbitrary instance just draws
a random constructor from a set,
possibly biasing certain outcomes.

**Generic** arbitrary instance looks like this:
```{.haskell #tree-type}
data Tree        a =
    Leaf         a
  | Branch [Tree a]
  deriving (Eq,Show)

instance Arbitrary       a
      => Arbitrary (Tree a) where
  arbitrary = oneof [Leaf   <$> arbitrary
                    ,Branch <$> arbitrary
                    ]
```
Assuming we run QuickCheck with any size parameter greater than 1,
it will fail to terminate!

List instances is a wee bit better,
since it tries to limit maximum list length to a constant
option:

```{.haskell}
instance Arbitrary  a
      => Arbitrary [a] where
  lessArbitrary = sized $ \size do
    len  <- choose (1,size)
    vectorOf len lessArbitrary
```

Indeed QuickCheck manual[@quickcheck-manual], suggests an error-prone manual method of limiting
the depth of generated structure:
```{.haskell}
data Tree = Leaf Int | Branch Tree Tree

instance Arbitrary Tree where
  arbitrary = sized tree'
    where tree' 0 = liftM Leaf arbitrary
	  tree' n | n>0 = 
		oneof [liftM Leaf arbitrary,
	          liftM2 Branch subtree subtree]
  	    where subtree = tree' (n `div` 2)
```

This fixes non-termination issue, but still may lead to unpredictable waiting times for nested structures.

# Complexity analysis

We might be tempted to compute average size of the structure.
Let's use viral reproduction rate estimate for a single
rewrite of `arbitrary` function written in conventional way.

We compute a number of recursive references for each constructor.
Then we take an average number of references among all the constructors.
If it is greater than 1, the property test will certainly fail to terminate.
If it is slightly smaller, we almost certainly wait a long time.

What is an issue here is not just non-termination which is fixed by error-prone manual process
of writing own instances that use explicit `size` parameter.

The much worse issue is unpredictability of the test runtime.

Given a _maximum size_ parameter (as it is now called) to QuickCheck,
would we not expect that tests terminate within linear time of this parameter?
At least if our computation algorithms are linear with respect to input size?

Currently for any recursive structure like `Tree a`,
we see some exponential function. For example $ size^n $, where $n$ is a random variable.

# Solution

We propose to replace implementation with a simple state monad that actually
remembers how many constructors were generated:
```{.haskell #costgen}
newtype Cost = Cost { unCost :: Int }
  deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum,Bounded,Num)

newtype CostGen                               a =
        CostGen {
          runCostGen :: State.StateT Cost QC.Gen a }
  deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad, State.MonadFix)
```

We track the spending in the usual way:
```{.haskell #spend}
spend :: Cost -> CostGen ()
spend c = CostGen $ State.modify (-c+)
````

Then we limit our choices when budget is tight:
```{.haskell #budget}
currentBudget :: CostGen Cost
currentBudget = CostGen State.get

(<$$$?>) = ($$$?)

($$$?) :: CostGen a -> CostGen a -> CostGen a
cheapVariants $$$? costlyVariants = do
  budget <- CostGen State.get
  if budget > (0 :: Cost)
     then costlyVariants
     else cheapVariants
```

In order to conveniently define our budget generators,
we might want to define a class for them:
```{.haskell #less-arbitrary-class}
class LessArbitrary a where
  lessArbitrary :: CostGen a
  default lessArbitrary :: (Generic a, CGArbitrary (Rep a)) => CostGen a
  lessArbitrary = to <$> cgArbitrary  

```

Then we can use them as implementation of `arbitrary`
that should have been always used:
```{.haskell #arbitrary-implementation}
fasterArbitrary :: LessArbitrary a => QC.Gen a
fasterArbitrary = sizedCost lessArbitrary

sizedCost :: CostGen a -> QC.Gen a
sizedCost gen = QC.sized $ (`withCost` gen)
```
Then we can implement `Arbitrary` instances simply with:
```
instance Arbitrary where
  arbitrary = fasterArbitrary
```
Of course we still need to define `LessArbitrary`,
but after seeing how simple was a `Generic` defintion `Arbitrary`
we have a hope that our implementation will be:
```{.haskell}
instance LessArbitrary where
```
That is - we hope that the the generic implementation will take over.

# Introduction to generics 

Generics allow us to provide default instance,
by encoding any datatype into its generic `Rep`resentation:
```{.haskell}
data Rep a = ...
```
Our prime example is encoded in the following way:
```{.haskell}
undefined :: Rep (Tree a)
```

For simple datatypes, we are only interested in three constructors:
* `:+:` encode choice between constructors
* `:*:` encode a sequence of constructor parameters
* `M1`  encode metainformation about the named constructors

There are also some short cuts:
* `U1`  is the unit type
* `Rec0` is a recursive instance of the same datatype

This generic representation can then be matched by generic instances.
Example of `Arbitrary` instance from [@generic-arbitrary] serves as a basic example
```
```

Generic instances have been proposed[@generic-arbitrary], which exhibit the same problem:

```{.haskell}
...
```

# Generic implementation

It is apparent from our previous considerations,
that we can reuse code from the existing generic
implementation when the budget is positive.
We just need to spend a dollar for
each constructor we encounter:
```{.haskell #generic-less-arbitrary}
```

However, when the budget is low,
we need to find the least costly constructor each time.

To this end we need to use a type family that computes a cost of a generic implementation:

```{.haskell #generic-less-arbitrary}
-- | Calculates count of constructors encoded by particular ':+:'.
-- Internal use only.
type family SumLen a :: Nat where
  SumLen (a G.:+: b) = (SumLen a) + (SumLen b)
  --SumLen (a G.:*: b) = (SumLen a) + (SumLen b)
  SumLen  a          =  1

type family ConsCost a :: Nat where
  ConsCost (a G.:*: b) =     (ConsCost a) + (ConsCost b)
  ConsCost (a G.:+: b) = Min (ConsCost a) (ConsCost b)
  ConsCost  a          = 1
``` 

First we will recursively descent down the constructors that
are not relevant for the problem:

```{.haskell #generic-less-arbitrary}
class CGArbitrary a where
  cgArbitrary :: CostGen (a x)

instance CGArbitrary G.U1 where
  cgArbitrary = pure G.U1

instance LessArbitrary       c
      => CGArbitrary (G.K1 i c) where
  cgArbitrary = G.K1 <$> lessArbitrary

instance CGArbitrary f
      => CGArbitrary (G.M1 i c f) where
  cgArbitrary = G.M1 <$> cgArbitrary

instance (CGArbitrary a, CGArbitrary b) => CGArbitrary (a G.:*: b) where
  cgArbitrary = liftA2 (G.:*:) cgArbitrary cgArbitrary
```

But we will need to make a choice on which constructor to use:
```{.haskell #generic-less-arbitrary}
instance (CGArbitrary      a,  CGArbitrary      b,
          KnownNat (SumLen a), KnownNat (SumLen b)
         ) => CGArbitrary (a G.:+:              b) where
  cgArbitrary = costFrequency
    [ (lfreq, G.L1 <$$$> cgArbitrary)
    , (rfreq, G.R1 <$$$> cgArbitrary) ]
    where
      lfreq = fromIntegral $ natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (SumLen a))
      rfreq = fromIntegral $ natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (SumLen b))
```


```{.haskell #generic-less-arbitrary}
genericLessArbitrary :: (Generic a, CGArbitrary (Rep a)) => CostGen a
genericLessArbitrary = to <$> cgArbitrary

genericLessArbitraryMonoid :: (Generic          a
                              ,CGArbitrary (Rep a)
                              ,Monoid           a)
                           =>  CostGen          a
genericLessArbitraryMonoid  =
  pure mempty <$$$?> genericLessArbitrary

type family Min m n where
  Min m n = Min_ m n (CmpNat m n)

type family Min_ (m::Nat) (n::Nat) (o::Ordering) where 
  Min_ m n 'LT = m
  Min_ m n 'EQ = m
  Min_ m n 'GT = n

```

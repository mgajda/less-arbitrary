To build this you need:
* Haskell Stack
* for documentation:
  - pandoc
  - xelatex with standard science article packages
    - easiest to get as MacTeX on Mac
    - `apt-get install -y texlive-recommended` on Ubuntu
* enTangleD for code generation (if you want to edit `.md` source file)

To read more, look into `less-arbitrary.md` which is literate source file.

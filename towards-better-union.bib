abstract = "Publisher Summary
This chapter presents the benchmark specifications developed for XMark, a set of queries and lessons learned while executing the workload specification on a number of platforms. The benchmark was designed top–down, taking the standardization issues around XML as a starting point. The data exchange format XML has been penetrating virtually all areas of Internet application programming. Thus, electronic commerce sites and content providers who rely heavily on the new technology are increasingly interested in deploying advanced data management systems for sites whose data volume exceeds toy sizes. The complexity of the challenge has also attracted the attention of the database research community. Early efforts mainly concentrated on schema issues and the theory of organizing data without a fixed schema, which first seemed incompatible with existing technology. However, as XML gained more and more momentum and numerous commercial products appeared on the market—many more being under development—the focus of research shifted; specific technical issues like physical data breakdown and query performance have started to determine the success or failure of implemented XML-based solutions."

Consequently, errors such as access to non-existent members are not detected until runtime.",

In the second part of the talk we will propose a new system of notations for types, which we call alternating direct acyclic graphs, and show that for a system of sybtype inequalities over a lattice, if it has a solution then there is a solution whose alternating dag is of polynomial size in the size of the original system. There are examples showing that the well known dag representation of types is not good enough for this purpose, already for the two-element lattice.",

@inproceedings{quickCheck,
  abstract = {Quick Check is a tool which aids the Haskell
                 programmer in formulating and testing properties of
                 programs. Properties are described as Haskell
                 functions, and can be automatically tested on random
                 input, but it is also possible to define custom test
                 data generators. We present a number of case studies,
                 in which the tool was successfully used, and also point
                 out some pitfalls to avoid. Random testing is
                 especially suitable for functional programs because
                 properties can be stated at a fine grain. When a
                 function is built from separately tested components,
                 then random testing suffices to obtain good coverage of
                 the definition under test.},

abstract = {The Haskell compiler GHC includes a type inference engine for a rather sophisticated type system.  You might worry that a complicated type sytsem leads to a very complicated type inference engine.   You'd be right, but we have learned a lot about how to structure type inference so that the complexity does not get out of control.

In this talk, given at Zurihac 2019, I explain how GHC's type inference engine actually works by first generating constraints and then solving them.
